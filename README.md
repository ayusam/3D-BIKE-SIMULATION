# 3D-BIKE-SIMULATION
This project is on “3D BIKE SIMULATION” in Computer Graphics using OpenGL functions. It is a user interactive program where in the user can view the required display by making use of the input devices like keyboard and mouse. This project mainly consists of a bike and a robot. The Robot is made to sit on the bike, so that it looks like a man riding it. The bike can be viewed in any direction and in any angle by rotating camera using mouse. The bike is accelerated and its movements are controlled using the keyboard. For viewing, we can also use arrow key to follow the moving bike.
